### Computational social scientist & PhD candidate

Sociologist seeking roles in data science or quantitative social science. I have 7+ years of experience analyzing text, spatial, network, and survey data, with broad skills in statistics, programming, and written and visual communication of analytic insights. My dissertation research uses NLP methods and survey data to explain variations in expressions and experiences of community across digital and location-based contexts.
